# README

A simple starter project to get up and running quickly with [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), a Git backed Wiki.

## Usage
To get up and running execute the following steps:

1. Clone this repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:leonardreidy/gollum-starter.git
```

2. Run the convenience script to initialize:

```sh
make init
```

3. Run the convenience script to start:

```sh
make start
```

4. Run the convenience script to stop (when you're done):

```sh
make stop
```

## Notes
To get started quickly, you can also run:

```sh
make all
```

This will initialize the project from scratch and start the service. Do not use this if you have already initialized the project.
